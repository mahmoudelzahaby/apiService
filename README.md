# DevOps Challenge: API Service Deployment
### This project demonstrates the deployment process of an API service using .NET. It involves creating the API service, Dockerizing it, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, creating a Helm chart, and deploying it to Kubernetes.

--------------------------
## Overview
This project showcases the end-to-end DevOps process for deploying an API service using .NET, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Helm, and Kubernetes.
--------------------------
### Steps
- Create the API Service: Develop the API service using .NET framework, implementing the desired functionality and endpoints.

- Dockerize the API Service: Containerize the API service using Docker for consistent and portable deployments.

- Set up CI/CD Pipeline: Configure a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

- Create Helm Chart: Generate a Helm chart defining the deployment, service, and configurations.

- Deploy to Kubernetes: Deploy the API service to a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart.

### Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git

Install prerequisites: .NET framework, Docker.

Start the API service locally: 
'''
docker run {dockerimage:tag}
'''

Access the API endpoints using the provided base URL: GET http://localhost:port/api/endpoint
---

### CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process.
Customize the pipeline according to your preferred CI/CD tool.
Include stages for building, testing, and deploying the API service.
Helm Chart
The Helm chart defines the deployment, service, and configuration of the API service in Kubernetes.
Customize the chart templates and values.yaml file as per your requirements.


### Deploying to Kubernetes
Ensure access to a Kubernetes cluster.

Install Helm and set up the Helm client.

Package the Helm chart: helm package chart-directory.

Deploy the API service to Kubernetes using the Helm chart: helm install release-name chart-name.tgz.
